            I am Emmanuel Kiwamu a graduate of the American University of
            Nigeria. I studied Information Systems and concentrated in
            Information Security and assurance. I have had little work
            experience as an intern graphics designer and front desk staff. I am
            very passionate about Information security, Cyber Security and Data
            Science. I am very conversant with photoshop and CorelDraw for
            graphics design, Figma for product design. I am also a growing
            learner of front end development and an active learner of
            Information security and Cyber security as that is what I am very
            passionate about. I am a very dedicated and hardworking fellow that
            is quick in learning and meeting up to the tasks if given a job.
